= DB Charmer - ActiveRecord Connection Magic Plugin

+DbCharmer+ is a simple yet powerful plugin for ActiveRecord that significantly extends its ability to work with
multiple databases and/or database servers. The major features we add to ActiveRecord are:

1. Simple management for AR model connections (+switch_connection_to+ method)
2. Switching of default AR model connections to separate servers/databases
3. Ability to easily choose where your query should go (<tt>Model.on_*</tt> methods family)
4. Automated master/slave queries routing (selects go to a slave, updates handled by the master).
5. Multiple database migrations with very flexible query routing controls.
6. Simple database sharding functionality with multiple sharding methods (value, range, mapping table).

== Installation

To add +DbCharmer+ to your project, please add the following line to your Gemfile:

  gem 'db-charmer'

Warning: If you are looking to use this gem with Rails 2.x, please use the following line:

  gem 'db-charmer', '< 2.0.0', :include => 'db_charmer'

_Notice_: If you use +DbCharmer+ in a non-rails project, you may need to set <tt>DbCharmer.env</tt> to a correct value
before using any of its connection management methods. Correct value here is a valid <tt>database.yml</tt>
first-level section name.

== What Ruby and Rails implementations does it work for?

We have a continuous integration setup for this gem on with Rails 3.0, 3.1 and 3.2 using a few
different versions of Ruby. Support for Rails versions below 3.0 has been dropped in 2.0 release of
DbCharmer.

CI is running on TravisCI.org: https://travis-ci.org/kovyrin/db-charmer
Build status is: {<img src="https://secure.travis-ci.org/kovyrin/db-charmer.png?branch=master" alt="Build Status" />}[https://travis-ci.org/kovyrin/db-charmer]

At the moment we have the following build matrix:
* Rails versions:
  - 3.0
  - 3.1
  - 3.2
* Ruby versions:
  - 1.9.3
  - 2.0.0 (Rails 3.2+ only)
  - 2.1.0 (Rails 3.2+ only)
* Databases:
  - MySQL

Starting with version 1.8.0 we support Rails versions 3.2.8 and higher. Please note, that Rails 3.2.4
is not officially supported. Your code may work on that version, but no bug reports will be
accepted about this version.


== Is it Thread-Safe?

Starting with version 1.9.0 we have started working on making the code thread-safe and making sure
DbCharmer works correctly in multi-threaded environments. At this moment we consider multi-threaded
mode experimental. If you use it and it works for you - please let us know, if it does not - please
make sure to file a ticket so that we could improve the code and make it work in your situation.
